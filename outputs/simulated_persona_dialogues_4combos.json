Another project that comes to mind is the transformation of the Detroit Riverwalk, which revitalized the waterfront and created public access to the river. It’s made a significant positive impact on the community by enhancing outdoor spaces for recreation and gatherings. Urban projects like these can really change how people experience their environment. Are there any other urban spaces you feel have made a big difference?"
